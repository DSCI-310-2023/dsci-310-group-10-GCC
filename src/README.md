This is a folder keeping all the analytical code for this project.

In this project, we particularly use R to conduct the analysis. 

In this directory,

- 'R/' is a folder which contains all the refactored code and the testing code.

- 'forest_fire_prediction.ipynb' runs with an R Kernel and executes the main analysis.

- 'analysis.Rmd' loads all the generated data summarize the project with only the necessary tables and graphs. 

- '01_data_loading.R', '02_data_processing.R', '03_data_visualization.R' and '04_data_conclusion.R' are successive code for the analysis in order.
