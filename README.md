## Short project summary

Forest fires are a type of uncontrolled and unwanted fire that usually have a negative impact. 
In 2007, forest fires in the Atlas Mountains, located on the northern coast of Algeria, killed several people as it spread rapidly due to hot, dry winds.

In this project, `the problem we're willing to solve` is:
- Can we predict forest fires given the weather conditions by using $k$ nearest neighbours? 

For DSCI310 project which based on this previous project created in DSCI100, we intend to realize trustworthy and reproducive workflows
according to the lectures' content and any extra relevant resource.
